# Counter App

A simple counter application built using **React** that demonstrates the use of the `useState()` hook. The app allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numerical counter.

## Features

- **Increment**, **decrement**, and **reset** the counter value with buttons.
- Displays the current counter value dynamically.
- Responsive layout and styled with **Bootstrap** for easy accessibility.
- Includes **Bootstrap Icons** for an enhanced user interface.

## React Concepts Used

### `useState()` Hook

- The `useState()` hook is used to manage the state of the counter. In this app, the `counter` variable is updated using the `setCounter` function whenever the user interacts with the buttons.
