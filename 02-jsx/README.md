# Simple Blog Layout

## Project Overview

This project is a simple blog website built using React and Bootstrap. The primary goal of this project is to learn and practice JSX, which allows us to combine HTML and JavaScript in React components.

## Objective

- To understand the fundamentals of JSX.
- To learn how to create reusable React components.
- To design a basic blog layout using Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Features

- A simple layout for a blog homepage.
- Responsive design using Bootstrap.
- Components include a navbar, blog post list, and footer.
- Practice combining HTML and JavaScript using JSX.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building user interfaces using components.
